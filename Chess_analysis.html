      <h2>What Chess Is</h2>
      <p>
        Chess is a two-player abstract strategy game based on maneuvering sixteen unique pieces to checkmate the opponent’s king.
        Although often perceived as ancient and unchanging, chess has gone through major mechanical evolution over 1500 years.
        Recent personal gameplay sessions (in both online and physical formats) informed this analysis and helped clarify how the
        mechanics communicate ideas about power, hierarchy, and war.

      <h2>Origins, Designers, and Early Publishers</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Early Design (Chaturanga)</summary>
        <p>
          Chess has no single identifiable designer. Its earliest ancestor, <em>chaturanga</em>, emerged in India around the 6th century.
          Chaturanga represented the four divisions of the Indian military: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.

      <details>
        <summary>Persian Adaptation (Shatranj)</summary>
        <p>
          Persians adapted the game into <em>shatranj</em>, altering piece movement and naming conventions. It then spread across the
          Islamic world and into Europe.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Medieval Transmission</summary>
        <p>
          There was no commercial “publisher” in the modern sense. Chess spread through courts, scholars, travelers, and later
          through printed manuals once printing technology became widely available.

      <h2>Mechanical Inspirations</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Indian and Persian Strategy Games</summary>
        <p>
          Chess inherits mechanics from Indian war simulations and Persian strategy traditions. The concept of asymmetric piece
          behavior and an 8×8 battlefield came directly from these earlier designs.

        <summary>European Rule Changes</summary>
        <p>
          Between 1400–1500, Europe accelerated the pace of the game. Major changes included the queen gaining long-range power,
          bishops gaining diagonal freedom, and pawns becoming more dynamic with new movement and promotion rules.

      <h2>Non-Game Influences</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Warfare and Social Hierarchy</summary>
        <p>
          Chess was shaped by the military structures and class systems of the societies that adopted it. The pieces reflect political
          and social roles—kings, queens, bishops, knights, and commoners.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Religion, Trade, and Philosophy</summary>
        <p>
          Islamic scholars debated chess’s morality while preserving its theory. In Europe, monks used it to teach morality, patience,
          and strategic foresight. Across cultures, chess became a metaphor for order, fate, and rationality.

      <h2>Backstory (Real and Mythic)</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Legends and Myths</summary>
        <p>
          Many cultures claimed chess was invented by a philosopher or wise courtier to teach humility or strategic thinking. These
          myths reveal that chess was always treated as more than a pastime.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Historical Purpose</summary>
        <p>
          In courts, chess symbolized noble discipline and intellectual refinement. It served as both entertainment and a teaching tool
          about war, hierarchy, and foresight.

      <h2>Chess as Cultural Reflection</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Medieval European Influence</summary>
        <p>
          The game’s modern rules embody European political structures: feudal hierarchy, religious authority, and gendered power.
          The queen’s enhanced abilities may reflect rising political influence of historical queens.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Global Politics and Empire</summary>
        <p>
          Chess spread via conquest and trade, then became standardized during European expansion. In the 20th century the Cold War
          turned chess into a symbolic battlefield—most famously during the Fischer vs. Spassky match.
